# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

To evaluate and compare the user experience (UX) of 2–3 competing websites or apps using heuristic evaluation principles. Identify usability issues, analyze differences, and propose design improvements to enhance overall user satisfaction and functionality.

## Algorithm:

1.Select 2–3 competing websites or apps for evaluation.

2.Define a set of usability heuristics (e.g., Nielsen’s 10 heuristics) as evaluation criteria.

3.Conduct an independent heuristic evaluation on each app/site by expert reviewers, noting usability issues and severity.

4.Compare and analyze the key findings across the selected apps/websites.

5.Prioritize issues based on severity and frequency for each app/site.

6.Design proposed changes or improvements addressing the identified usability problems.

7.Validate the impact of changes through user testing or feedback.
